## Introduction

**Load Ants** is a high-performance, versatile DNS proxy service that converts traditional UDP/TCP DNS queries to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). It acts as an intermediary between your clients using standard DNS protocols and modern secure DoH providers, enabling enhanced privacy, security, and flexible routing capabilities.

### Why DNS-over-HTTPS?

Traditional DNS queries are transmitted in plaintext, exposing your browsing history to potential monitoring, hijacking, or manipulation. DoH addresses these issues by:

-   **Encrypting DNS traffic** - Prevents snooping by network intermediaries
-   **Enhancing privacy** - Hides DNS queries from ISPs and other network observers
-   **Improving security** - Reduces vulnerability to DNS poisoning and spoofing attacks
-   **Bypassing censorship** - Helps circumvent DNS-based blocking techniques

## Key Features

-   üîÑ **Protocol Conversion**

    -   Seamlessly transforms UDP/53 and TCP/53 DNS requests to DoH (RFC 8484)
    -   Fully supports both GET and POST HTTP methods
    -   Handles multiple content formats including `application/dns-message` and `application/dns-json`

-   üß† **Intelligent Routing**

    -   **Flexible Matching** - Route DNS queries based on domain patterns:
        -   Exact domain name matching
        -   Wildcard domain matching (`*.example.com`)
        -   Regular expression domain matching
    -   **Custom Actions** - Define what happens for each match:
        -   Forward to specific upstream DoH group
        -   Block queries (responds with NXDOMAIN)

-   üåê **Flexible Upstream Management**

    -   **Grouping** - Organize DoH servers into logical groups with independent settings
    -   **Load Balancing** - Configure per-group balancing strategies:
        -   Round Robin (RR) - Equal distribution among servers
        -   Weighted Round Robin (WRR) - Prioritize servers by capacity
        -   Random - Non-deterministic selection for enhanced privacy
    -   **Authentication Support** - Secure communication with private DoH providers:
        -   HTTP Basic Authentication
        -   Bearer Token Authentication
    -   **Resource Optimization** - All upstream groups share HTTP client pool for efficiency

-   ‚ö° **Performance Enhancements**

    -   **Intelligent Caching** - Built-in DNS cache reduces latency and upstream load
    -   **Connection Pooling** - Reuses HTTP connections for efficiency
    -   **Adjustable TTL** - Configure minimum and maximum TTL for cached responses

-   üîÅ **Reliability**

    -   **Retry Mechanism** - Automatically retry failed DoH requests with configurable attempts
    -   **Customizable Timeouts** - Fine-tune connect and request timeouts

-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Administration**
    -   **YAML Configuration** - Simple, human-readable configuration
    -   **Configuration Validation** - Strict validation at startup or with test mode
    -   **Health Endpoint** - Monitoring integration for operations teams
    -   **Prometheus Metrics** - Comprehensive metrics for monitoring via `/metrics` endpoint

## Architecture

Load Ants follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

-   **Server**: UDP/TCP listeners accepting traditional DNS queries
-   **Router**: Matches domain names against rules to determine processing action
-   **Upstream Manager**: Handles communication with DoH servers, including load balancing and authentication
-   **Cache**: Stores DNS responses to improve performance and reduce upstream load
-   **Handler**: Processes DNS queries by coordinating between other components

## Configuration

Load Ants is configured using a YAML file. Below is an explanation of the key sections:

### Server Configuration

```yaml
server:
    listen_udp: "0.0.0.0:53" # UDP listening address and port
    listen_tcp: "0.0.0.0:53" # TCP listening address and port
```

### Health Check

```yaml
health:
    listen: "0.0.0.0:8080" # Health check server listen address and port
```

### Cache Settings

```yaml
cache:
    enabled: true
    max_size: 10000 # Maximum number of entries (10-1000000)
    min_ttl: 60 # Minimum TTL in seconds (1-86400)
    max_ttl: 3600 # Maximum TTL in seconds (1-86400)
```

### HTTP Client Settings

```yaml
http_client:
    connect_timeout: 5 # Connection timeout in seconds (1-120)
    request_timeout: 10 # Request timeout in seconds (1-1200)
    idle_timeout: 60 # Idle connection timeout in seconds (5-1800)
    keepalive: 60 # TCP keepalive in seconds (5-600)
    agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

### Upstream DoH Server Groups

```yaml
upstream_groups:
    - name: "google_public"
      strategy: "roundrobin" # Strategy: roundrobin, weighted, random
      servers:
          - url: "https://dns.google/dns-query"
          - url: "https://8.8.4.4/dns-query"
            method: "get" # Optional: get or post, default is post
            content_type: "message" # Optional: message or json, default is message
      retry:
          attempts: 3 # Number of retry attempts (1-100)
          delay: 1 # Initial delay in seconds (1-120)
      proxy: "http://user:pass@proxyserver:port" # Optional proxy

    - name: "secure_dns"
      strategy: "weighted"
      servers:
          - url: "https://example-doh.com/dns-query"
            weight: 70 # Weight for weighted strategy (1-65535)
            auth:
                type: "bearer" # Authentication type: basic or bearer
                token: "YOUR_API_TOKEN" # Token for bearer auth
          - url: "https://another-doh.com/dns-query"
            weight: 30
            auth:
                type: "basic"
                username: "user"
                password: "pass"
```

### Routing Rules

Load Ants uses a priority-based matching system for DNS routing:

1. **Exact Match** (highest priority) - Direct match for full domain names (e.g., `example.com`)
2. **Specific Wildcard Match** - Matches domains using wildcards (e.g., `*.example.com`)
3. **Regex Match** - Matches domains using regular expressions (e.g., `^(mail|audio)\\.google\\.com$`)
4. **Global Wildcard Match** (lowest priority) - The catch-all rule (`*`) that matches any domain

When configuring routing rules, keep this priority order in mind. The global wildcard (`*`) should typically be placed as the last rule to serve as a default when no other rules match.

```yaml
routing_rules:
    # Block specific domains
    - match: "exact" # Match type: exact, wildcard, regex
      pattern: "ads.example.com" # Pattern to match
      action: "block" # Action: block or forward

    # Route internal domains to specific upstream group
    - match: "wildcard"
      pattern: "*.internal.local"
      action: "forward"
      target: "internal_dns" # Target upstream group

    # Use regex for pattern matching
    - match: "regex"
      pattern: "^ads-.*\\.example\\.com$"
      action: "forward"
      target: "adblock_dns"

    # Default rule (catch-all)
    - match: "wildcard"
      pattern: "*" # Match everything
      action: "forward"
      target: "google_public" # Default upstream group
```
